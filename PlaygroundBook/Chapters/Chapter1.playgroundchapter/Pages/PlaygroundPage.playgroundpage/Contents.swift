 #  Welcome everyone
 
 Welcome, today we gonna talk a little bit about accessibility, and how important it is for everybody, especially for us. In this world we got people who do not have the same experience we have, because they are different: they have some limitations.
 But these limitations are not a problem, these people are still amazing and capable of doing great things and providing life experiences you won't believe!
 
 This playground is for them.
