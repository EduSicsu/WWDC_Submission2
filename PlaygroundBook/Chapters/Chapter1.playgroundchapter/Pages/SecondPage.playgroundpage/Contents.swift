 # About me
 
 First of wall, my name is Eduardo Oliveira Lopes, I have 22 years old and I'm design student. So, nice to meet you.
 
 In less than one year everything has completely changed in my life, and I have no idea how important is accessibility, after that I researched a lot about this, and I also discovered the developers do not give the value they should for that topic.
 
 I felt bad for this, so many people are ignored I needed to do something about that, so when the submissions for the scholarship were opened. I did not think twice about what the theme of my project would be.
