 # Why did I do this Playground?
 
 First of all, my name is Eduardo Oliveira Lopes,  I am 22 years old and I'm a design student. So, nice to meet you.
 
 In less than one year everything has completely changed in my life, and before I had no idea how accessibility is important, then I researched a lot about this, and I also found out that most times developers do not value that topic as much as they should.
 
 It made me feel bad, that so many people are ignored and I needed to do something about that, so when the submissions for the scholarship opened, I didn't think twice about what the theme of my project should be.
