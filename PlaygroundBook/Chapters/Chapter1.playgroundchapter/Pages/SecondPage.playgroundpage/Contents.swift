 First of all, my name is Eduardo Oliveira Lopes,  I am 22 years old and I'm a design student. So, nice to meet you.
 
 In less than one year everything has completely changed in my life, and before I had no idea how accessibility is important, then I researched a lot about this, and I also found out that most of time developers do not give the value they should for that topic.
 
 It made me feel bad, so many people are ignored and I needed to do something about that, so when the submissions for the scholarship opened, I did not think twice about which the theme of my project would be.
